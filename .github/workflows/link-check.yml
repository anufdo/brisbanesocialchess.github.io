            The link checker found some broken links in your markdown files. Please review and fix them:

            - Check the workflow logs for details: ${runUrl}
            - Relative links starting with \`/\` are automatically converted to \`https://brisbanesocialchess.github.io/\`
            - Make sure all internal links point to existing files/pages

            You can run the link checker locally with: \`npm run check-links\``;
